# Shut up! Will you shut up?!

I am your king. Burn her anyway! I'm not a witch. Why? Burn her anyway!

Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! And this isn't my nose. __This is a false one.__ *The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.* That is why I am your king.

## Why?

And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! I have to push the pram a lot. Oh, ow!

1. Well, what do you want?
2. I'm not a witch.
3. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

### And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.

Bloody Peasant! She looks like one. Well, we did do the nose. Why? And the hat. She's a witch! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!

* You don't vote for kings.
* Who's that then?
* I am your king.

Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! And the hat. She's a witch! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

> Bloody Peasant! Now, look here, my good man. Why? We want a shrubbery!! Burn her!

…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? What a strange person. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Well, how'd you become king, then? Look, my liege! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!

Well, we did do the nose. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Camelot! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

We want a shrubbery!! He hasn't got shit all over him. Be quiet! I dunno. Must be a king.

Burn her! Burn her! Why do you think that she is a witch? You don't vote for kings. Why do you think that she is a witch?

Burn her anyway! The nose? Burn her! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! We found them.

A newt? …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Why?

Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Shut up! He hasn't got shit all over him. She looks like one.

The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Camelot! But you are dressed as one… Camelot!
