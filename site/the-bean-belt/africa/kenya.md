Kenya is another heavy-hitting origin known for some of the highest-quality coffees in the world. Even a middling Kenyan coffee has been known to go toe-to-toe with other countries' highest-quality coffees. High-grown Kenyan coffees have a characteristic sparkling acidity, and certain varietals, including SL28, have very distinct black-currant notes, along with notes of berries, tropical fruits, and citrus fruits (especially grapefruit). Kenyan coffee must often contend with coffee leaf rust and coffee berry disease, and the Kenyan government has taken steps to develop high-quality, disease-resistant plants, such as Ruiru 11 and Batian. Still, quality is king in Kenya; the extreme skill of the producers and the country's unique processing techniques, which are distinguished by a double fermentation process, contribute to the high quality of Kenyan cups. Kenya has several growing regions, although most fall within a Swath of land clustered around the slopes of Mount Kenya, which extends south almost to the capital of Nairobi and north to Meru. There is another cluster of growing regions to the west, near the Ugandan border around Mount Elgon, and a few more isolated areas here and there.
