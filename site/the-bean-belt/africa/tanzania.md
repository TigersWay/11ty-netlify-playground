### TANZANIA

1,400 to 2,000 masl | 678,000 bags | mostly washed

Located on the eastern shore of Africa, Tanzania is not aS well recognized as Kenya, its superstar neighbor to the north, but its specialty coffee can be top-notch and quite similar to Kenya's. Uniquely, much of Tanzania's coffee is grown under the shade of banana trees on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. The elevation and the shade contribute to a slow-developing bean that offers bright and extremely complex cups. For whatever reason, Tanzanian peaberry coffee is popular in the United States, despite the fact that Tanzania does not produce more peaberries than other countries. Peaberry coffee is not a variety of coffee but rather the name of a naturally occurring mutation in the beans. Most of the time, coffee cherries contain two flat-sided beans. About 5 percent of the time, a coffee cherry produces only one bean (instead of two), which is small and round like a pea (hence the name!). Peaberries are often separated from the regular flat beans before roasting because their shape makes them roast differently, but sometimes they aren't, and you'll find them in a bag of regular coffee. Many people prize peaberries because they believe all the qualities of the two flat beans are concentrated into one bean. Others think they' re no different from regular coffee beans. In any case, don't be surprised if you see a Tanzanian peaberry coffee for sale at your local shop.
