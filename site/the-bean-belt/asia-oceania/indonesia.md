### INDONESIA

8,00 to 1,800 masl | 6,679,000 bags | Giling Basah and washed

Indonesia, located between the Indian and Pacific oceans, is made up of more than 13,000 volcanic islands. Coffee is grown on several of these islands, and a few of them are often treated as their own origin. It's not uncommon to see "Sumatra" on a bag of coffee instead of "Indonesia." Roasters may even go a step further by naming the region or washing station within the island. Because of this, I will break down this origin by some of its most popular islands.

#### Sulawesi

The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has been a specialty-coffee origin since the beginning of the specialty coffee movement.  Most coffee is grown in the Tana Toraja region, located in mountainous South Sulawesi, by small indigenous producers.  Many producers in this region tend to use a unique method (called Giling Basah, or "wet hulling") for washing the beans, which (at the risk of oversimplifying the process) leaves the beans with a greater moisture content when they leave the farm than other processes do. This method results in coffee with a heavy body and funky earthy notes, including cedar and green pepper, that tend to divide the acidity-loving specialty coffee community. However, more common washing techniques were introduced in the 1970s to help bring out the acidity, sweetness, and fruitiness of Sulawesi beans and provide a more standard way to experience Sulawesi coffee in the specialty world. You may see both kinds available at coffee shops. Other growing regions on the island include Mamasa, Gowa, and Utara.

#### Sumatra

Sumatra is an island in western Indonesia. Like Sulawesi's crop, much of the coffee produced here is processed with the Giling Basah method, which results in earthy flavors, such as herbs, mushrooms, spices, and mustiness. Again, this goes against the typical acid-forward profile of much of today's specialty coffee. But because this coffee has low acidity and is often quite smooth, it might be a good option for those of you who don't care for acidic qualities all that much. Another unique characteristic of Sumatran coffee beans is their distinctive blue-green color (which can throw off less-experienced roasters and sometimes cause them to overroast the beans). Most Sumatran coffee is produced in the northern highlands. You may see the region of Mandailing listed on a bag of coffee, but this is actually the name of an indigenous tribe that grows coffee in Tapanuli. Other growing regions include Aceh, Lintong and Lampung.

#### Java

Java, another Indonesian island, is the birthplace of both typica and one-half of the classic Mocha-Java blend (which you'll still see for sale, despite its being one of the world's oldest blends). In fact, Java is so deeply steeped in coffee's history that the word itself is a slang term for coffee. However, most arabica production in Java (and Indonesia as a whole) has been replaced by robusta, and in Java's case, most high-quality production has been moved to fellow isles Sumatra and Sulawesi. Still, there is some specialty coffee production in the eastern highlands on the Ijen Plateau. Java also produces a significant amount of kopi luwak, the most expensive coffee in the world, which is processed in the intestines of an animal called a civet and then collected as droppings. (For what it's worth, most people seem to think it tastes as you might expect: like something that belongs in the toilet.)
