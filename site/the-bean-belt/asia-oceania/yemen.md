### YEMEN (MOCHA)

1,500 to 2,000+ masl | 20,000 bags | mostly natural

A small country on the Arabian Peninsula just across the way from Ethiopia, Yemen has been growing and exporting coffee since close to the beginning of the coffee trade. Its most famous coffee, Mocha, which has nothing to do with mocha drinks or chocolate, originally got its name from the port city Mokha on the country's western coast. This high-quality coffee is the other half of the famous Mocha-Java blend. Many Yemeni coffees grown today are heirloom varieties, similar to what Ethiopia grows, that are processed via traditional methods. Most of the coffee is produced on the west side of the country, and coffee professionals often describe the flavor profile as "wild," with bright acidity and complexity. However, Yemeni coffee is not all that common in the United States. Exports from Yemen have shrunk over the years as deadly conflict in the country has disrupted its coffee industry, but producers continue to cope and grow with remarkable resilience. In 2015, a group of Yemeni coffee exporters escaped Yemen to attend the annual SCA conference and reintroduce specialty Yemeni coffee to the world. As individuals and organizations help to build the infrastructure necessary for cash-crop specialty coffee cultivation, we may start to see more Yemeni selections on US shelves.
