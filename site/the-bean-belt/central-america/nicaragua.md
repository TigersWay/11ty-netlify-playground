Nicaragua is a relative newcomer to the coffee industry, not getting its start until after a long period of political and economic instability ended in the 1990s. In fact, Nicaraguan coffee imports were banned in the United States until 1990. Nicaragua struggled to compete on the fierce commodity markets and has since rebuilt its coffee program to focus more on high-quality, specialty-grade coffee. Nicaragua, the largest country in Central America, produces a spectrum of coffee across a variety of microclimates in three regions. The North Central region produces the majority (more than 8o percent), and two of the better-known departments, Matagalpa and Jinotega, with their volcanic soil and tropical climates, are contained within it. The next-biggest producing region, the Northeast, accounts for only about 14 percent of total production. Nueva Segovia and Estel√≠ are two of the more well-regarded departments in this region. The last region, the South Pacific, produces the least amount of coffee and has a lower elevation than the other regions. An estimated 95 percent of Nicaraguan coffee is shade-grown across 108,000 hectares. Much of this coffee is certified organic. Nicaraguan coffees tend to hew closely to the typical Central American mode: moderate acidity and body with a range of citrus-fruit notes. Coffees from the Nueva Segovia area have established a reputation for their chocolaty notes as well.
