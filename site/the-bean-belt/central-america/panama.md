About 80 percent of Panamanian coffee production takes place in the west around the town of Boquete in the mountainous region of Chiriqui, where more than 100 years of coffee tradition inform the cultivation of some of the finest coffees in the world. On the west side of Chiriqui, closer to the Costa Rican border, lies the city of Volc√°n, around which volcanic soil and warm sea breezes encourage coffee production. Panama has made a concerted effort to prove itself in the specialty coffee market. In 1996, a small group of coffee producers formed the Specialty Coffee Association of Panama (SCAP) to promote high-quality coffee. Today, the organization has more than quadrupled in size and has earned global recognition for its coffees. In the early 2000s, the Panamanian government set aside 8,000 hectares for "quality" and "ecological coffees. Gesha, one of the finest varietals in the world, thrives in Panama, and many Panamanian producers, like the famed Hacienda La Esmeralda, have dedicated most of their acreage to exclusively cultivating this bean. In 2015, Hacienda La Esmeralda earned the highest bid-a whopping $140.10 per pound-for its gesha at SCAP's annual Best of Panama auction. The best Panamanian geshas bring out the best in the beans. jasmine-like floral aromas, bright citrus acidity, and distinct bergamot notes. Panama's unique landscape provides various microclimates capable of producing flavor notes as diverse as vanilla and maple or citrus and wine.
