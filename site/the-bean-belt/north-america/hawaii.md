### HAWAII

100 to 1,000 masl | 45,360 bags | mostly washed

Hawai'i is the only place in the United States that is able to produce high-quality coffee (although I've read that commercial growers are cropping up in California and Georgia). Hawai'i has a handful of growing regions-most of which have mineral-packed, volcanic soil - but the Kona region on the Big Island generally overshadows the rest in the public eye, as it is said to produce some of the world's finest coffee: silky, floral, and with a remarkable balance of sweetness and acidity. However, the Kona growing region is only about 2,000 acres, which means there is never that much available. Kona coffee is incredibly expensive (and some say overrated), and you're unlikely to see it in a pure form outside of a blend. Aside from Kona, many other regions on the Big Island have ideal yet distinct microclimates. Puna, where most coffee grows in or above lava flows, is quite new to the scene but is capable of producing coffee with a lot of acidity and very diverse flavors. Ka'u, which has been gaining accolades in recent years, is said to be reminiscent of Central American coffees. Hamakua, home to limited production on very fertile farms, is known for coffee with low acidity and a rich, full body. Coffee is also produced on the islands of Kaua'i, Maui, and Moloka'i.
