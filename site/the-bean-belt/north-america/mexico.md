Mexico cultivates coffee on about 760,000 hectares across 12 different states. A hectare is equal to about 2.47 acres, so that's roughly 1.88 million acres. The soil in these states tends to be a bit acidic, which contributes to the coffee's character. Most coffee farms in Mexico are small (less than 25 hectares) and organized into cooperatives that specialize in organic coffee. The largest producing region is Chiapas, which shares a mountain range with one of Guatemala's best growing regions and accounts for about a third of Mexico's total production. Other well-established regions include Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca, which, along with Chiapas, account for about 95 percent of all production. You might also see coffee from Guerrero. In he past, Mexican coffee was considered to be low-grown and low-quality, and certain to become filler, but the many small producers growing high-elevation, high-quality coffee in recent years have turned that image around. In the United States, many roasters buy Mexican beans based on the name of respected beneficios (coffee processing facilities) or fincas (farms). These coffees have the potential to show off interesting mixes of acidity and sweetness, notes of toffee and chocolate, lighter bodies, and creamy textures.
