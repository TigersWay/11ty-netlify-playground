### ECUADOR

Although the national goverment does not offer much support to specialty coffee growers in Ecuador (farms that specialize in low-quality arabica and robusta bound to become instant coffee granules get top priority), some farmers are willing and able to grow coffee that produces interesting, high-quality cups. As of this writing, Ecuador's specialty exports are very small. Caf√© Imports, one of the few buyers that bring Ecuadorian coffee to the United States, posted on its website that in 2014, it had purchased 3 of only 30 total shipping containers of specialty coffee exported from Ecuador. Still, the country has all the right ingredients: It's smack dab on the equator (hence the name), and it has that volcanic soil that coffee loves, not to mention a very wet rainy season and extreme elevations. Growing regions include Loja (where 20 percent of all arabica is grown), Pichincha, Zamora-Chinchipe, Carchi, and El Oro. The best Ecuadorian coffees have a great balance of sweetness and acidity.
