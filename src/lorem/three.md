# You've swallowed a planet!

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

It's art! __A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?__ *!* You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

## Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

1. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!
2. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!
3. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

### I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

* I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
* I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
* Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You hit me with a cricket bat. You've swallowed a planet! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

Saving the world with meals on wheels. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You hit me with a cricket bat. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You've swallowed a planet!

*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
