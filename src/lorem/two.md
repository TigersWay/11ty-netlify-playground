# Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

I'm trying not to, kid. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.

Don't underestimate the Force. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. __I call it luck.__ *Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.* The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

## I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Ye-ha! He is here. You don't believe in the Force, do you? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

1. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
2. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
3. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

### Red Five standing by.

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Don't underestimate the Force. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

* Ye-ha!
* Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
* The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. As you wish. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. As you wish. I call it luck. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

Don't underestimate the Force. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Ye-ha! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Don't underestimate the Force.

I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I'm trying not to, kid. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

I call it luck. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. What!? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
