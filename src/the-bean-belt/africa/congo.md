### DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONG0

700 to 1,500 masl | 135,000 bags | mostly washed

Located in the center of Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is currently in the process of rebuilding its specialty coffee program. The country has been ravaged by political conflict and violence for the past few decades, which has dramatically affected its coffee exports: 130,000 tons per year in the mid-1980s dropped to 8,000 tons by 2012. However, you do see DRC coffee in the United States, and efforts are being made to revitalize the industry; in May 2016, the country held its second annual Saveur du Kivu, a national cupping competition. Growing regions are mostly to the east, where the soil is volcanic and the elevations are high. These regions include Beni near the Ugandan border as well as Kivu and Ituri. Lake Kivu influences DRC's (and Rwanda's) coffees (as other large lakes in the area influence the coffee of other East African countries), providing interesting savory notes such as herbs, spices, nuts, or pepper, along with a good balance of acidity and sweetness. These coffees can also suffer from the potato defect.
