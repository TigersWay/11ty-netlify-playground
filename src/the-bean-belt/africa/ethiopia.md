### ETHIOPIA

1,500 to 2,200 masl | 2,872,000 bags | washed and natural

Ethiopia is one of specialty coffee's most respected origins and has some of the finest coffees in all the land. Perhaps it's no coincidence that arabica coffee was first discovered within Ethiopia's borders. One of the most exciting things about this origin is that literally hundreds of heirloom varieties are cultivated by as many small producers (you'll often see the term heirloom varieties, as opposed to regions, on bags of Ethiopian coffee). Because of this, Ethiopian coffee can range in flavor, although it is generally known for intensely floral or fruity flavors. That being said, some growing regions are more distinctive than others. For example, Yirgacheffe, a small subset of the Sidama growing region in the south, is known for producing coffee with characteristic Earl Grey flavors. Harar, in the highlands to the east, is known for the unique flavor of its washed and sun-dried coffees. Coffee grown in the west (e.g., Limu, Djimmah, Lekempti, Welega, and Gimbi) is generally fruitier (many Ethiopian coffees taste like blueberries, which is heightened by dry processing) than coffee grown elsewhere. Whatever its flavor, I find Ethiopia's coffee to be big and bold - it's often the first coffee that people say tastes like something more than just coffee. A good Ethiopian coffee gives up its yummy flavors without much fuss, making it a good choice for beginners.
