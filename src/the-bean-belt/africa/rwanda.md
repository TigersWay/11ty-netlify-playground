### RWANDA

1,400 to 1,800 masl | 237,000 bags | mostly washed, some natural

With the help of government programs and investments, Rwanda has been positioning itself as a specialty coffee producer since the early 2000s. Today, it's common to see this origin on the menu at craft coffee shops all over the United States. Like its neighbors, Rwanda mostly grows bourbon and bourbon derivatives, which are generally full bodied and quite sweet. Distinguishing Rwandan flavor notes include raisin and other dried fruits as well as stone fruits, citrus, and sweet spice. Of all the East African coffees affected by the potato defect, Rwandan coffees are often hit the hardest, which tarnishes their image a bit. Most coffee is produced in the north (the region of Rulindo grows some of the country's best coffees) and in the west, particularly around the Albertine Rift mountains and Lake Kivu. The south and east do not yet grow significant amounts of specialty coffee, but they have all the resources (high elevations, good soil, willing producers) to do so in the future.
