### PAPUA NEW GUINEA

1,300 to 1,900 mast | 796,000 bags | mostly washed

Papua New Guinea (PNG) occupies half of the island of New Guinea in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Although it only  produces about 1 percent of the world's arabica (most of it organic), PNG is an interesting origin for specialty coffees; cups tend to be delicate and light bodied, and to vary in flavor from chocolate to citrus depending on the growing region. About 40 percent of PNG's population grows coffee, and 95 percent of them tend tiny plots of a few hundred coffee trees max (but often even fewer than that). These smallholders produce an estimated 90 percent of all of PNG's coffee. As old estates dissolve and small producers become more organized and skilled, coffee in PNG has improved in quality and can  sometimes achieve excellent results. Even so, there is very little infrastructure in PNG, and the process of selecting which cherries to harvest tends to be poor, which can lower the overall quality of the coffee. Growing regions include the Western Highlands/Wahgi Valley (you may see bags labeled "Kunjin" or "Ulya," which are regional processing mills), the Eastern Highlands, and Chimbu (often spelled Simbu) Valley.
