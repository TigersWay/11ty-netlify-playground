Coffee from the highlands of Guatemala is considered to be among the finest coffees in the world, the kind that can knock you over the head with its bold acidity and body. One of the country's most famous regions, Antigua, is nestled among three volcanoes, which provide coffee's favorite mineral-rich soil. Antigua often produces cups with dark, earthy notes like spice, flowers, and smoke. Coffees from Fraijanes and Atitlan, both also rich in volcanic soil, are similarly prized. In the southeast corner of the country, Huehuetenango's Caribbean-facing slopes produce distinctly fruit-forward coffees, which may be due in part to how producers dry the coffee during production. Other growing regions include San Marcos with its slopes facing the Pacific, Nuevo Oriente near the Honduran border, and Cobán, which is sandwiched between Antigua and Atitlán. Guatemalan coffees that are sold to roasters under regional names must meet the corresponding flavor guidelines set forth by the Asociación Nacional del Café, the national coffee authority that has been supporting farmers since 1960. Guatemalan coffee has seen an uptick in quality in recent years, owing to Guatemalan producers' high level of participation in the specialty coffee market.
