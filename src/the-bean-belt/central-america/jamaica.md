### JAMAICA

600 to 2,000 masl | 12,000 bags | mostly washed

Jamaica is the third-largest Caribbean island and home to some of the most expensive specialty coffee on the planet: Blue Mountain. The coffee is named after the (government-designated) region where it's grown, located toward the northeast portion of the island. The elevation of these mountains isn't that high, but it's said that the almost-perpetual blue fog slows down the development of the bean (and increases the flavor). Like Kona coffee in Hawai'i, Blue Mountain is a type of typica that grows under the watchful eye of Jamaican coffee producers and a regulatory board. It's said to have superb cup qualities, including rich flavors, bright acidity, and great body and sweetness. Others say Jamaican coffee lacks the complexity and juiciness that people have come to expect of high-quality specialty beans. Japan snatches up a lot of Jamaica's crop each year, although some of it makes it to the United States. Because it's so rare, fraudulent Blue Mountain labeling is not uncommon.
