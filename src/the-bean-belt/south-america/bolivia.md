### BOLIVIA

155 to 2,300 masl | 46,000 bags | mostly washed

This landlocked country in central South America is just starting to gain recognition in the specialty coffee market after years of selling lower-quality coffee destined for commercial blends. About 95 percent of Bolivia's coffee production takes place in the Yungas region along the eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains. Other growing regions include Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and Tarija. While large commercial estates still exist, the government has taken strides to return tracts of land to small producers, who now cultivate 85 to 95 percent of Bolivia's coffee, most of which is grown organically. Although the country has all the necessary qualities (climate, rainfall, elevation) to produce high-quality beans, its lack of infrastructure, technology, and efficient export systems makes growing specialty coffee difficult. Producers are also getting out of the coffee game in favor of more stable ventures, like coca, the plant used to make cocaine, at an alarming clip. Bolivia's coffee exports reached a 10-year record low in 2014-15. That said, Bolivian specialty coffee does show up occasionally in the United States, and infrastructure is improving through programs designed to encourage farmers to grow coffee, rather than coca, as a cash crop. The best Bolivian coffees are said to be sweet, clean, and well balanced.
