### BRAZIL

400 to 1,600 masl | 36,867,000 bags | natural and pulped natural

Brazil is the biggest coffee producer in the world, accounting for about 30 percent of the world's coffee, and it churns out everything from low-grade commercial coffee to fine specialty beans. Brazil is also the biggest country in South America, which means the terroir across its six major producing regions (Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Paraná, and Rondônia, all with various subregions) can vary dramatically. However, Brazil lacks the high elevations you see in Colombia, East Africa, and Central America, which contributes to the beans' mild acidity, Brazilian producers also tend to use natural and pulped natural processes, which add sweetness and complexity to make up for the lack of acid and which contribute to the national flavor. If you don't like acidic coffee, a Brazilian coffee is an approachable alternative. Washed Brazilian coffees do exist, but they are somewhat rare. Although Brazilian coffee gained a strong reputation for quality in the early 2000s, it seems like professionals tend to have mixed feelings about Brazilian coffees now. For what it's worth, some of Andreas's favorite single-origin espresso in recent years has come from Brazil. Brazilian coffees are certainly worth trying, especially if you prefer mild coffee.
