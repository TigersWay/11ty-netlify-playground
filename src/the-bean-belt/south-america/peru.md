Peru does not have the same kind of name recognition in the coffee world as other South American countries, especially those like Brazil and Colombia that benefit from robust national coffee organizations. However, Peruvian coffee has that bright acidity of high-grown coffee-the Andes Mountains run the length of the country, encompassing nearly 28 microclimates. Although Peru struggles with infrastructure issues, in recent years, the Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego del Perú, the body that oversees the country's agriculture, has been offering more modern resources and agricultural education to producers, who tend to be indigenous peoples using traditional processing methods. About 6o percent of Peru's coffee beans are grown in the north in regions such Cajamarca, Amazonas, San Martin, Piura, and Lambayeque. About 30 percent are grown in the central part of the country, which includes Junin, Pasco, and Huánuco. The southern regions such as Puno, Cusco. and Ayacucho grow the least amount of coffee. Many Peruvian coffees are organic (although Peruvian organic farmers are struggling mightily with coffee leaf rust) and tend to be creamy with sweet notes, such as toffee, caramel, chocolate, and nuts.
